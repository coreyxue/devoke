Devoke is designed to help you developing a good daily Bible reading hobit. After finishing your devotion everyday, you can earn cridets by checking in to Devoke. Once you had enough cridets, you may spend them at the Devoke store and exchange for real rewards. Your daily check-ins will also contribute to the over-all church devotion curve.  You can find this curve from your profile page. It shows how many people has done their devotion each day.  Devoke also provides you a way of sharing your thoughts with others.
